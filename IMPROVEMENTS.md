# IMPROVEMENTS

### MISSING FEATURES:

- [ ] Ability to create a profile for a player
- [ ] Ability to compare the score with the other players
- [ ] Allow the quiz to get the questions from a local server
- [ ] Allow the creation of sets of questions (With a common subject)
- [ ] Custom Background: Could add an option to change background color or even different background options. Maybe an option to upload your own.
- [ ] Provide a template for users so they know the format for uploading their own questions
- [ ] Along with player profile, keep track of player's high score or quickest response times
- [ ] Ability to see which answers were wrong/right
- [ ] Navigate among the questions
- [ ] Correct answer pop up page after correct answer that tells you the amount of points earned

### BUGS:

- [ ] Quiz Freeze: Sometimes the test will hang after answering a question wrong instead of ending the quiz.
- [ ] After answering some questions wrong, the next question will not appear until the timer times out
- [ ] Some questions are too long for the answerfield and so not readable
- [ ] Some answers are too long for the container and overflow out

### FEEDBACK:

- [ ] The quiz can be implemented in schools as a way to test students
- [ ] The form moves around a lot when entering information.
- [ ] The client does not scale correctly to higher res displays (mine is 3k and only about half my screen is filled with content)
- [ ] It is not obvious what the "Delete Savegame" does
- [ ] Timer slider should go from left to right because most people read from left to right and tracking time gets hard from right to left.
- [ ] The timer filling up animation unnecessarily grabs the user's attention for a second or two. It is a fast movement from left to right so it is hard not to get distracted by it. I would prefer if it was rendered as filled and started decreasing slowly.
- [ ] The quizzes can be more structured. IMO a quiz having different number of options for every question would look frustrating, it would be better to enforce some rules.
